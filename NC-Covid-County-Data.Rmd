## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
covid19.df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv")

library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ISLR)
library(caret)
library(glmnet)
library(leaps)
library(missMDA)
library(VIM)
library(FactoMineR)
library(pls)

covid19.df <- covid19.df %>% 
  filter(state == "North Carolina") %>% 
  select(county, cases, deaths)

case.fatality.rate.df = covid19.df %>%
    mutate(CFR = (deaths/(cases)*100)) %>%
    group_by(county) 
    summarize(n=n()) 
    ###arrange(desc(CFR)) 

case.fatality.rate.df %>% head(n = 10)
```

```{r}

```
